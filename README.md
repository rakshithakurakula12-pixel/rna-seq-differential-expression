# RNA-Seq Differential Expression Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete **RNA-Seq differential expression workflow** using publicly available datasets from GEO (NCBI).  
It is designed to showcase my dry-lab bioinformatics skills for research internships and jobs.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Perform quality check and normalization  
- Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)  
- Generate PCA, volcano plots, and heatmaps  
- Interpret biological pathways and gene enrichment  

---

## 🧬 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** R / Python  
- **Libraries:** DESeq2, edgeR, ggplot2, pheatmap, pandas, matplotlib  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / RStudio, GEOquery, Bioconductor

## 🚀 Steps (Will be added soon)
1. Download dataset from GEO  
2. Preprocess raw count data  
3. Normalization + DE analysis  
4. Visualization  
5. Biological interpretation  

---

## 📌 Dataset
A publicly available RNA-seq dataset will be used (e.g., GSEXXXXX from GEO).
